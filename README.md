# Majer Lazer
Phaser.io app where you get to shoot laser's from your eyes... and that's it.

## Install

Run

`bower install`

and then

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

and go to `http://localhost:8000`

## Contributing
So you want to make this throwaway game something truly special. I get it. I used [Pixlr](pixlr.com/editor) to do the character models, located in the `pixlr` directory.  I bootstrapped the PNGs using this excellent [8-Bit Character Generator](http://8biticon.com/) and added a body.

File issues, suggest additional characters, add baddies, or a real server. Submit pull requests to `master` and we'll cut versions using `git tag`.

Special thanks to Marshall Contrell for being the main character model.
